# Struggling On

Well, it's been a tough few weeks lately right?

The cumulative effects of having being already been an isolated one-person small business owner for several years, plus the extra isolations of COVID-19, and two young kids in homeschooling have meant I've been working a lot slower than usual.

There's been a mixed bag of work across Django REST framework, HTTPX, HTTPCore, Uvicorn, Starlette this month, but more piecemeal than usual.

Where work needs to be prioritised next is in two places...

**Django REST framework**

We've been due a new release here for a few months now. It really will come this month.

**HTTPX**

The 0.13 release series is in great shape, and should be pretty much considered our 1.0 beta candidate.

There's a few tiny corners that could do with finessing before we push a more formally API-stable 1.0 release.
If you're interested in keeping an eye on those then take a look [over the 1.0 milestone](https://github.com/encode/httpx/milestone/1).
