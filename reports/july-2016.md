Introduced a plugin interface for Core API codecs, and released the following packages.

* `openapi-codec` - A decoder and encoder for OpenAPI / Swagger schemas.
* `jsonhyperschema-codec` - A decoder for JSON HyperSchema.
* `hal-codec` - A decoder and encoder for the HAL hypermedia format.
* `corehtml-codec` - An encoder for an HTML formatted output.

## Admin

Work on allowing sponsors to manage their accounts and sponsorship details is planned for the first half of August. I will be notifying sponsors once that becomes available. In the meantime if you want to make any changes, or wish to cancel, please email me at tom@tomchristie.com

## Finance

Against a baseline of Â£48,000/yr revenue (not salary) we're now at around 75% sustainability.

Reaching financial sustainability will have a dramatic effect on the long-term prospects for the project. If you've not yet done so, please do consider signing up as a sponsor, at https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/

If you believe your business might consider our sponsorships, but would like some help in making the business case clear, please get in touch.
