Slightly shorter monthly report than usual this month,
due to a combination of illness and family holiday. Happily Carlton Gibson's paid role on the project has allowed us to press on.

November's work should be back on track again. I'll probably plan on putting API Star work on the backburner slightly and focusing on REST framework a little more.

## New releases

October has seen four new releases, from 3.7.0 to 3.7.4.

## Triage

Impressivly we're down from 145 open tickets at the start of the month to 114 at the end. That breaks down to less than 100 open issues, and less than 20 open pull requests.

## Finances

I'll be reviewing the company's end of year finances this month, so next month's report will give a good idea of where the project is standing financially.

As ever, thanks to all our sponsors, contributors, and users for your ongoing support.
