# Django REST framework

There's been a 3.11.1 release in order to bring our supported versions of
Django up to date.

The 3.12 release is now the highest priority item of work for the coming month.

# HTTPX

There's been a vast amount of work on `httpx`, culminating in our 0.14 release.

Our [release notes](https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0140-august-7th-2020) are the best place to get an in-depth view onto exactly what's changed in this release.

The most notable headlines are:

* Our HTTP/2 support is now fully optional. **You now need to use `pip install httpx[http2]` if you want to include the HTTP/2 dependancies.**
* Our HSTS support has now been removed. Rewriting URLs from `http` to `https` if the host is on the HSTS list can be beneficial in avoiding roundtrips to incorrectly formed URLs, but on balance we've decided to remove this feature, on the principle of least surprise. Most programmatic clients do not include HSTS support, and for now we're opting to remove our support for it.
* Our exception hierarchy has been overhauled. Most users will want to stick with their existing `httpx.HTTPError` usage, but we've got a clearer overall structure now. See https://www.python-httpx.org/exceptions/ for more details.

However that doesn't really do justice to the [huge amount of refinement](https://github.com/encode/httpx/commits/master) that we've undertaken in 0.14, in preparation for the upcoming HTTPX 1.0 release.
