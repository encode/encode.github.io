## Summary

Work has been a little thin on the ground lately due to personal reasons,
but should be picking up again now.

## Triage

Here's how the triage work has gone this month. The numbers here are the total
number of open issues and pull requests for each project at the start and
end of the month:

* Starlette: 67 → 51
* Uvicorn: 87 → 83
* REST framework: 231 → 243
* HTTPX: 42 → 51

Personally I've been starting to remove myself from work on Starlette and Uvicorn,
while still making myself available for any management roles that might be required there.
My experience is that it's only really viable to act as lead on one or two major projects,
so for the time being I'm looking to focus on REST framework and HTTPX.

## Dropping the `rfc3986` dependency

My most substantial piece of work this month has been a pull request that removes
the need for the `rfc3986` dependency from `httpx`.

Reviews for this work would be most welcome.

See pull request [httpx#2252](https://github.com/encode/httpx/pull/2252) for details.
