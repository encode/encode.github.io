# New functionality

The `requests` test client and `coreapi` test client are almost complete. These tools will allow you to write test your application using either `requests` or a `coreapi` client. Interestingly they also allow you to write tests that can be run either locally, or directly against your staging and/or live environment.

There has been a 2.0 release of the `coreapi` package, and a new release of the `coreapi-cli` tool. This brings support for uploads and downloads to our Python client library and command line tool. The Python client library is now extensively documented, at http://core-api.github.io/python-client/

Releases of both a `raml-codec` package, and a `django-rest-raml` third-party app are working towards bring the RAML API console as a drop-in option for documenting your API.

Further work has been ongoing in improving the schema support introduced in 3.4, and ensuring the 2.x iteration of `django-rest-swagger` presents a seemless documentation option. There are lots of areas that have been addressed here, and the 3.5 release should address the vast majority of remaining issues.

# Finance

Against a baseline of Â£48,000/yr revenue (not salary) we're now at about 95% sustainability.

As ever, reaching the crucial tipping point of sustainability is tremendously important to the long-term success of the project. If your business has not yet signed up for a paid plan, please consider doing so.
