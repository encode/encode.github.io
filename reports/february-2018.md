## 3.8 release

We're continuing to work towards a 3.8 release. Our headline feature for this release is planned to be a management command for outputting your API schema, initially with support for OpenAPI 3 format, but possibly later adding RAML and JSON HyperSchema as options.

The majority of my time is currently focused on a new release of `coreapi` - The package that REST framework uses for schema generation and schema driven client libraries.

I've also started work on a hosted service that'll integrate nicely with this work - hopefully I'll be able to start talking about this more over the next couple of monthly reports.

## Triage

Our ticket count is currently standing at around 100 open issues, and 30 pull requests.

## Finances

Our income is currently around Â£5000/mo. This currently pays for Carlton Gibson's contracting time, 50% time from myself, and a small amount of ongoing time from Anna Ossowski, handling our invoices and other operations.

I'm currently spending the other 50% of my time on freelancing.

As ever, thanks to all our sponsors, contributors, and users for your ongoing support.
