##Â Django REST framework

We're finally about ready to roll the 3.10 release. I'm planning to make a
release in the first half of next week.

There's been numerous tweaks, improvements and documentation fixes over the last few weeks.

## HTTP3

The `http3` package is now fully documented at [https://www.encode.io/http3/](https://www.encode.io/http3/)

Work this month has included:

* Support for using directly with WSGI or ASGI apps.
This allows for usage as a test client, or for service mocking.
* Concurrent reads/writes during the request/response cycle in order to properly
handle HTTP endpoints that issue early responses, without having read the
request body. Smart switchover between read and write timeouts.
* Improved protocol detection to include HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/0.9.
* Various changes to bring request headers closely in line with "requests".
* Fixed default SSL cipher settings.
* Fixes for HTTP/2, including honoring stream flow control.
* Support for multipart file uploads.
* Support for either async or sync dispatchers.
* Various other bug fixes & minor improvements.

If we can find a good way forward I'd like this to end up as "requests3", but
that's still an open ended conversation right now.

## Starlette

* Work towards integrating `http3` as the test client, in place of `requests`.
* Support for `request.state`, as a place to store arbitrary per-request state.
* Updates for ASGI 3, and various other minor changes.

## Databases

The `databases` package is now fully documented at [https://www.encode.io/databases/](https://www.encode.io/databases/)

* Connection locking during queries, in order to handle async concurrency safely.
* Iterations will now always implicitly occur within a transaction.
* Support for native decimal types in returned result records.

## Uvicorn

* Support for ASGI `raw_path`.
* Various other bug fixes & minor improvements.

## What's next

The status of the various projects under the Encode banner currently looks like:

* `django-rest-framework` - Releasing 3.10, then dealing with any remaining OpenAPI schema issues.
* `uvicorn` - Working towards a 1.0 release.
* `starlette` - Working towards a 1.0 release.
* `databases` - Working towards a 1.0 release.
* `http3` - Working towards a beta release. Determining if this will end up as "requests3" or not.
* `typesystem` - On hold, but to be revisited.
* `orm` - On hold, but to be revisited.
* `apistar` - To be determined. The API documentation generator, and schema-driven
client library might fill an important bit of the ecosystem, once REST framework
has moved to OpenAPI schema.

I've also started to explore how a Starlette-based admin interface might look.
