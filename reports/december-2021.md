Notes:

* For tax purposes, the salary consists of both PAYE and dividends, which I've not bothered to distinguish between.
* Similarly, I've not distinguished between personal tax and corporation tax in this breakout.
* Recurring services include Heroku, AWS, Domain registration, Password manager, Phone rental, Bank standing charges and others.
* For the 2020-2021 year, working through Encode OSS was my sole income.
