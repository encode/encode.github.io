### Finances

Catching up on monthly finances, trimming down on a couple of expenses.

A rough breakdown of how Encode's monthly finances currently look...

* Income: £5,100 (~65% Stripe subscriptions, ~30% GitHub sponsors, ~5% direct billing.)
* Salary: £3,700
* Expenses: £650 (Fixed desk in a co-working space, accountants, software subscriptions.)

Taxes are missing from that monthly breakdown because they're not monthly. I'll need to take a review at the end of the company's financial year in order to determining if we're currently breaking even or not. (Hint: It looks a bit tight, but probably about okay at the moment.)

### Django REST framework

I've been making a little time for triage on REST framework. Heavy going, given the age of the project and the volume of (often outdated) issues, but making a bit of progress on getting the pull request and issue numbers down.
