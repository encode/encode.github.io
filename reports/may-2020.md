# HTTPX

Work during May has mostly centred [on the HTTPX 0.13 release series](https://github.com/encode/httpx/commits?author=tomchristie&since=2020-04-30&until=2020-05-31).

The 0.13 release has been a big one for us, as it switches HTTPX over to using the same underlying
networking code for both the sync and the async cases.

It also introduces a really tight separation of concerns by splitting the core networking component
out into a really tightly scoped `httpcore` library, while the client smarts and nice request/response
APIs belong in `httpx`.
