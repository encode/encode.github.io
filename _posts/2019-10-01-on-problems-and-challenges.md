Something I'm working on lately is treating obstacles in my work and personal life as "Challenges", rather than as "Problems".

It's a small change in wording, but there's a big difference. A problem is something that likely has a solution, a distinct start and an end point. A problem is problematic. A negative that need to be zeroed away.

Challenges on the other hand can be difficult, but the *journey itself* is a reward, whatever end goal or staging posts we end up at along the way.

Treating bumps in the road as a challenge rather than a problem helps acknowledge the learning and self-insight that life experiences invariably afford us, and allows us to see otherwise difficult moments in a positive light.
